Hat Drawing Experiment
This project simulates an experiment to determine the probability of drawing a specified number of certain colored balls from a hat. 
It includes a Hat class for creating a hat with colored balls and a function experiment for conducting the experiment. 
The Hat class allows for initializing a hat with various colors and quantities of balls, and provides a method for drawing a specified number of balls at random. 
The experiment function runs multiple trials to calculate the probability of drawing a desired combination of balls, based on the number of balls drawn per trial and the total number of trials conducted.
