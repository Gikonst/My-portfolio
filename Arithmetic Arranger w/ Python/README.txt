This is a fun small project:

It's purpose is to accept a list of maximum 5 mathematical operations, which must only be additions or subtractions of two numbers.

Then the function which takes the list as parameter transforms the operations into vertical operations like we used to do as students in elementary school.

There is a second parameter "show_answers" which is provisionally set to False. In this case the user has to make the calculation by themselves.

In order to check the results the user can set the above parameter to "True". In this case the result appears under the bar.

Example: 134 + 5 = 139 ---> 

  134
+   5
-----
  139
