This is a time calculator project where the user has to give a specific time as 1st input in 12hr format using AM or PM.
As 2nd input the user must give  duration that they want to be added up to their initial hour.
3rd input is optional and is a day of the week.
The calculator adds the duration to the hour and gives out as output the time - days passed and the day (if any day was provided)                                                                                                      
This project gave me quite a torture at some point. Eventually, I found myself troubled with a bug regarding the calculation of the days.
I used LLMs but no LLM could offer a proper solution. In the end I realised that I was not adding a day every time the PM was changing to AM.
If you think about it 11:59 PM + 0:02 minutes is 12:01 AM and one day passed. Before I fixed the bug it did not tell if a day passed.
Thankfully, I mamnaged to pull it off.
