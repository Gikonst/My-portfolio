A small fun project for mainly working on my JavaScript skills. I created a small todo - grocery log where the user can log every item they need to buy
and store it in a list. They can remove any item at will and clear out the whole list of items. If the list is long, the user can use a filter bar to search for the 
item they look for. The items are stored in the local storage once logged and removed from it when the user removes them or clears the list.
